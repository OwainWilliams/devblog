Welcome to the new blog! This will be where I document some stuff now and then but to be honest, it's just a play ground.

My main home on the web is Owain.Codes and I'll keep most of my blogging over there. This is just a play ground for trying some non-umbraco stuff out! 

##### Netlify serverless hosting

yip, that's where this site kind of lives. It's hosted on Github and then I use Netlify to build and deploy the site. Kinda cool! 

Just testing some code snippet examples.

```javascript
$(document).ready(function() {
    console.log('More jQuery, wow!')
})
```

Seems to work.
